# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to see which city types are the most successful with this driving service: Rural, Urban or Suburban, as well as see where areas of improvement can be worked on in this company throughout the years of data provided about different rides, drivers, fares and more.

## Results:
I wasn't able to get some lines of code to function properly, but I still was able to gather enough information to see that driver-wise, being a driver in the rural areas is more beneficial based on average fare price per ride, as well as average per trip driver fare received.

Though this is an interesting statistic when you take into account that Urban drives are the most common request among users in the platform.

## Summary: 
The disparity I see most evidently is how the rural rides account for the least amount of profit, however get 4-12 times more than the average driver. This seems counter-intuitive, even if there are fewer drivers in rural areas. Another suggestion would be based on the amount of driver disparity in the different city types, as there is a way larger number of drivers in the urban areas which does not evenly distribute to other types. This shift in driver location would allow for a majority of drivers to see an increase in funds based on the fares, as well as giving an evenly distributed work flow to the other drivers that are covering many rides in farther away areas, therfore spending a lot more time of their day and not being able to have an easy work/life balance.
